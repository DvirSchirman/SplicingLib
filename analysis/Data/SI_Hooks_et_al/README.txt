List of available files:

- alignments

235 gene alignments in Stockholm format with #=GC INT line defining
intron features: [=5==] 5' splice site, [=BP==] branch point and [3]
3' splice site. Files are separated into two folders: CDS for genes
with introns in the coding region and UTR for genes with 5' UTR
introns. RPS22B/YLR367W, which has one 5' UTR intron and one intron in
the coding region is listed in the UTR folder.

- coordinates

GFF files for each species with the coordinates for each intron are
included. Note that both duplicated genes retained after WGD always
carry the same name (e.g. YGL076C and YPL189W are both listed as
YGL076C).
